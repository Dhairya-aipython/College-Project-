# College-Project-
In this project, I created a simple banking simulation program using Python. The main goal was to replicate real-life banking functions such as deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiry, bill payments, and simple loan calculations. This piece of software helps users understand how bank account transactions work and demonstrates basic programming skills.
